## Overview

One Thousand Origami Cranes is an interactive WebGL experience that simulates a flock of origami cranes in 3D space using Three.js. Inspired by the Japanese legend of the Thousand Cranes (千羽鶴), this project showcases elegant flocking behavior and beautiful motion dynamics.

---

## Key Features

1. **Realistic Flocking Simulation**
   - Uses the Boid algorithm to simulate lifelike crane movements.
   - Implements behaviors such as alignment, separation, cohesion, and obstacle avoidance.
   
2. **Traditional Japanese Color Palette**
   - Each crane is assigned a color from an authentic Japanese palette.
   - The aesthetic enhances the visual experience and cultural depth.
   
3. **Interactive Controls (dat.GUI)**
   - Adjust the number of cranes dynamically (1-1000).
   - Toggle between different container environments (**Ball or Box**).
   - Activate the **diffusion effect** to disperse cranes outward.
   - Enable **Time Rewind** to reverse the motion history.
   
4. **WebGL-Powered 3D Rendering**
   - Uses Three.js for smooth, high-performance rendering.
   - Implements fog effects and directional lighting for enhanced depth perception.
   
5. **OBJ Model Loader**
   - Loads and renders a custom origami crane 3D model.
   
6. **Adaptive & Responsive Design**
   - Optimized for different screen sizes and devices.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Live Demo**: [One Thousand Origami Cranes](https://rencheng0525.github.io/OneThousandOrigamiCranes/)
2. Use the **dat.GUI panel** to adjust the simulation parameters:
   - Change the number of cranes.
   - Switch between Ball and Box container modes.
   - Experiment with different behavior settings.
3. Click **Time Rewind** to play back the previous motion history.
4. Observe and interact with the mesmerizing crane movements!
